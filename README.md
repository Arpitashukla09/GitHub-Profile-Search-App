# GitHub-Profile-Search-App
This is a Jetpack Compose-based Android application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles and display their repositories. The app integrates the GitHub API, fetches repository data, caches responses using Room, and presents them in a lazy list. Users can click on a repository to view its details in a WebView.
